    information via a window that sits on top of the page content.

    current workflow. Contains no actions for the user to take.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transactional: Requires an action to be taken in order for the modal to be
    completed and closed. Contains a cancel and primary action buttons
  </li>
  <li>
    {" "}

    actions.
  </li>

    the user. Contains only a single button, commonly “OK”.

    <ul>

    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  <strong>CTA Priorities:</strong>
</p>
For accessibility, by default, all modals must have “Cancel” represented as a tertiary
button.

Most common use cases are represented in the states of each component below. As a guideline, CTA’s should be prioritized in this order when applicable.
The number of CTA’s in a modal may flex based on the context of the content.

1. “Don’t show again” (checkbox)
2. Back (Secondary button)
3. Primary CTA
4. Cancel (Tertiary button)

<p>
  <strong>Behaviors:</strong>
</p>

- For splash pages, modals may appear on page load.
- For actions, modals may appear after clicking on a tertiary CTA or button.
- x: Clicking the close x icon in the upper right will close the modal without submitting any data and return the user to its previous context.
- Click elsewhere: Clicking outside the passive modal area will automatically close the modal.
- Esc: Press ESC on the keyboard
