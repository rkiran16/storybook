# Tabs

<p>
    The tabs component is a flexible navigational utility. It can accommodate
    any number of tabs and will scroll upon overflow. Alignment options are left,
    center and right.
</p>

<p>
    Please note that scrolling will not work properly in the <code>center</code> alignment
    due to part of the child container overflowing past the start of the parent container and part
    past the end. Because of this, it is necessary for the tabs to align to the left or right at a
    breakpoint prior to needing to scroll.
</p>

<p>
    Javascript is necessary to automate centering the clicked tab if overflow is occurring. This
    will need to be implemented for each instance of the tab, and can be done so with the following
    javascript function:
</p>

<p>
    <code>scrollIntoView(&#123;block: 'nearest', inline: 'center', behavior: 'smooth'&#125;);</code>
</p>

## Options

<code>Show Icon</code>
<p>Allows for an svg icon on each tab</p>

<code>Tab Alignment</code>
<p>
    Allows for the alignment of tabs to the left, right, or center of the parent container. Note
    that if center alignment is used, the tabs will need to align to one side BEFORE the need for
    scrolling occurs as the screen size moves towards tablet/mobile.
</p>

<code>White background for active tab</code>
<p>Optional setting to make the background of the active tab white, for use on non-white backgrounds</p>
