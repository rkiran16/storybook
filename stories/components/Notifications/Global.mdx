# GLOBAL NOTIFICATIONS

Banners take over the top of an interface to show general notifications for the product or system, not a specific task.  

Message
- Messages should be short and succinct.
- Example messages: 
   1) Inform users of site-wide issues (ex: site down for maintenance)
   2) Display warnings or errors that will directly impact users’ ability to
complete certain tasks (ex: license expired)
- Only show one banner at a time.

Sizing
- Full width of viewport

Placement
- Do not cover other content with a banner notification.
- Place banner directly below the main navigation task bar. 16px between banner and the breadcrumbs.
- Banners are not sticky and should scroll with the other content on the page.

Dismissal
- Include an ‘X’ in the upper right corner to allow users to close the banner.
- They persist until they are dismissed by the user or the user takes action that resolves the notification.
- Banners may persist across multiple sessions.
