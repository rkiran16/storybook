# Inline

Inline notifications are nondisruptive and confined to a specific area in the UI. Inline notifications display both task-generated and system-generated messages and persist until they are dismissed by the user or the notification is resolved. They are frequently used in conjunction with field-level messages for errors in forms or other input areas.

Message

- Message starts with “Error!”, “Warning!”, “Success!”, or “Info!” Depending on the state of the notification
- Keep the message under two lines
- Be descriptive and give users clear next steps

Sizing

- Width varies based on the context and page layout
- Height is based on the content length

Placement

- Place near their related items
- Do not cover other content
- In forms, place at the top or bottom

Dismissal

- Persist until the user dismisses them or takes action that resolves the notification
- Option for development to have notifications that can’t not be dismissed in a card
