## What is Design System

<p>
  Design System is a reusable component library that helps design
  system contributors build UIs faster.The use of the system reduces design
  debt, accelerates the design process, and builds bridges between teams working
  in concert to bring products to life in their best visual form.
</p>
<p>But why it's so important?</p>

### Avoid the Tower of Babel of design

<p>
  As teams grow, it's common for designers to concentrate on discrete areas of
  an app and solve problems individually and not systematically. It can lead to
  a fragmented and not consistent visual language.
</p>

### Access to a single source of truth.

<p>
  We created this library to manage all brand and UX components to keep
  designers and engineers informed and easier to work processes.
</p>

### Design at Scale.

<p>
  Empower your process to create delightful and consistent user experiences
  across every product and collaborator - Everyone gets the building blocks to
  contribute right away on every topic. The aim of Design System is to help
  designers and developers deliver work faster and better.
